# Matplotlib

Using Matplotlib (Python) to screen for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of time. My objective was to contrast the effectiveness of Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and a Placebo, as treatment options. 

Findings:
I determined Capomulin to be the best treatment option. Mice treated with Capomulin saw a 19% decrease in Tumor Volume change over a 45-day period, showed the highest survival rates, and the most dramatic response to treatment sustained across the 45-day period.
